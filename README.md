# Identifying chemically equivalent atoms with Weisfeiler-Lehman test
Chemically equivalent atoms are atoms within a molecule that have the same chemical environment and exhibit identical properties in a given chemical context. We utilize an adaptation of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test for identifying chemically equivalent atoms within a molecule. We consider two atoms to be chemically equivalent if they have the same atomic symbol and their three hop neighbors are the same.
